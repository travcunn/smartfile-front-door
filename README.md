smartfile front door
====================
#####Problem
When moving offices, we found a button that could unlock the front door. However, there was only 1 button and it was mounted at an inconvenient spot in the office. Whenever there were visitors, someone would have to get up and press the button.

#####Solution
Using a relay, we can complete the door unlock circuit, just as the button did.
